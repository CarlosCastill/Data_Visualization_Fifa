## Part I - Data Visualisation
The video game Fifa 2017 has released its data to Kaggle as an open source for users to analyze it, where plenty of data analytics and scientists have access to. For the Assignment 1, I decided to evaluate a data visualisation (see bellow) made by the Kaggle User Hitesh Palamada about Fifa 2017 players.

## Part II - Deconstruct
The chosen data visualization had a large number of flaws that under my perspective as follow:
- Excessive amount of variables
- Non-logical comparisons
- Overlapping lines
- The axis is not shown
In general, it is an overcharged plot, where the author wanted to express the top 20 best players and all their skills in the polar plane.
The author has tryed to elucidate the 20 best players in the game and which their individual skills were, which lead us to identify that he has used the wrong visualisation, as I could simply have used a bar chart plotting the overall player rating and then plot their skills by their position in the field.
The data source has sufficient information to make a great data analysis with sufficient knowledge of the subject.
Taking into consideration that the question was "which are the top 20 best players in Fifa 2017 and which their individual skills are?", We can conclude that the visualization was not properly telling the story to answer the question, leading us to supose that he failed two parts in the Kaiser Fungâ€™s Trifecta.


## Part III - Reconstruct

##Conclusions
The reconstruction process focused in visualise what I conclude the author was trying to visualise.
Firstly, the creation of a bar plot was required to express the Top 20 best players in overall ranking, splitting them by their position in the field, which gives the user a better message in which players are the best and what role they perform in their National or club teams.
Secondly, and probably the most important one was the creation of four plots that shows the top 5 best players in overall, but in this case filtered by their position in the field, such as Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder and Attacker, and using only the most important skills for that roles, which makes the plots way less overcharged and more logical for soccer fans.
The use of a Cartesian plane with line plot, makes the information understanding a lot better than the original plot, with the presence of axes and nice colour codification. 
Note: apart from the original data, I had to go to Fifa 2017 website (http://www.fifauteam.com/fifa-17-position-change-cards-guide/#Bonus) to collect the common name of the roles, as in the data set those were using coded names, to finally create my own file to be merged with the original data file.
